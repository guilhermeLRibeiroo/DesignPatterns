## I'm learning Design Patterns

## ☆ Creational Patterns
> "*These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.*"

### Factory Method
> "*Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.*"

[Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)

### Abstract Factory
> "*Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.*"

[Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)

### Builder 
> "*Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.*"

[Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)

### Prototype 
> "*Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.*"

[Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)

### Singleton 
> "*Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.*"

[Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)


## ☆ Structural Patterns
> "*Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.*"

### Adapter
> "*Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.*"

[Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)

### Bridge
> "*Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.*"

[Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge)

### Composite
> "*Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.*"

[Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite)

### Decorator
> "*Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.*"

[Source](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)

### Facade
> "*Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.*"
