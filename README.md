## â˜† Creational Patterns
> "*These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.*"


### Factory Method
> "*Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.*"

### Abstract Factory
> "*Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.*"

<h3> [Builder] (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) </h3>
> "*Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.*"

### [Prototype] (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)
> "*Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.*"

### [Singleton] (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)
> "*Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.*"
