## ☆ Creational Patterns
> "*These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.*"


### Factory Method
> "*Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.*"

### Abstract Factory
> "*Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.*"
